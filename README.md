# bitXapi

BITxAPI is to be an API and SDK to get your website swapping easier.

Starting with the Quote API it will give quotes for, in order of development.

Thorchain, Thorchain_Streaming, Mayachain, Mayachain_streaming. Chainflip Jupiter Rango Fiat24

The first will give results compatible with @Thorswap's Swapkit SDK but as they are a USA based company focussed on Big companies, their focus is not on the average Crypto user and runs big regulatory risks from that country.

Bitx's company is based on a crypto friendly Caribean island!

Jupiter, Rango and Fiar24 results will not be compatible with Swapkit and so will require our plugins which we will also develop here.

Please buy the token here: https://token.bitx.cx Stakers will get half of any fees generated from swaps.

Token is on ETH right now but will be migrating to ARB soon. Purchases before migration will get a 10% bonus.
